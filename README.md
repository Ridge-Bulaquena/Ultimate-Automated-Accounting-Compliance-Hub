## 🚀 What is RuleKeeper?

**RuleKeeper** is not software.  
It is a **full professional services firm — rebuilt as AI infrastructure**.

Instead of hiring:
- an accounting firm
- a tax firm
- a compliance team
- junior lawyers
- internal auditors
- financial analysts

You deploy **12 specialized AI agents**, working **24/7**, cross-checking each other, explaining decisions in plain language, and **speaking to you conversationally**.

> Think: *CFO + CPA + Tax Lawyer + Compliance Officer + Risk Analyst + Auditor*  
> …merged into one autonomous system.

## 🧩 Core Philosophy

- **Zero manual bookkeeping**
- **Zero compliance panic**
- **Zero “call the accountant” moments**
- **Humans only step in when risk crosses a threshold**

Everything else is handled by AI.
